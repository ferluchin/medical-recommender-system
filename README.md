# Diabetes Patient Readmission Analysis

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset of diabetic patients from 130 US hospitals between 1999 and 2008. The goal is to understand the factors that lead to patient readmission.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008).

It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes, such as:

- Patient number
- Race, gender, and age
- Admission type
- Time in hospital
- Medical specialty of the admitting physician
- Number of lab tests performed
- HbA1c test result
- Diagnosis
- Number of medications
- Diabetic medications
- Number of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits in the year preceding the hospitalization.

## Analysis

The `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb` notebook contains the initial data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to uncover insights and correlations within the data.
